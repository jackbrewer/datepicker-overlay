# Datepicker Overlay Prototype


Datepickers suck. This is my attempt to make something better.

It is a semi-working prototype which would appear as an overlay when you need to pick a date and time.

This demo the result of a weekend of experimentation. The concept is fun but some user testing is needed to see whether this could be a viable, useful datepicker component.

### Todo List

* Figure out if/how it could work on small screens and handheld devices
* Responsive styling (currently fixed to 1200px wide x 1100 high)
* Implement the overlay functionality
