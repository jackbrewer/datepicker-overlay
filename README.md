# Datepicker Overlay Prototype


Datepickers suck. This is my attempt to make something better.

**DEMO:** [http://jackbrewer.github.com/datepicker-overlay/](http://jackbrewer.github.com/datepicker-overlay/)

It is a semi-working prototype which would appear as an overlay when you need to pick a date and time.

This demo the result of a weekend of experimentation. The concept is fun but some user testing is needed to see whether this could be a viable, useful datepicker component.

## Features

* Choose values by clicking links or typing in the text inputs
* Type and tab between inputs, straight to the submit button
* Use preset links to quickly access dates
* Input values validated / constrained
* Icons show correct day and live time

### Todo List

* Figure out if/how it could work on small screens and handheld devices
* Find a way to integrate day names
* Find a way to negate picking days which don't exist (Feb 30th)
* Responsive styling (currently fixed to 1200px wide x 1100 high)
* Implement the overlay functionality
